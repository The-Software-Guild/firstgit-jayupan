Dependency Injection
	Concept that an object should NOT be reponsible for directly instantiating the implementation of any of its member fields that might have more than one implementation
	In example, ClassRosterController should NOT be responsible for directly instantiating a new ClassRosterDaoFile...
Should we use it all the time?
	Sometimes, it's too much over-engineering
