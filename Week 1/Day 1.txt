Charles Washington (Instructor)
	Based in CST
	Bio Breaks = breaks
Standups
	Beginning everyday at 10AM EST
	Say Hi + explain how the assignments went with 
	Likely to be phased out as we get more coding
Overview
	Basics this week
	Core program will be later
	Eventually evolve into these basic functions into more specific complex functions
	MVC -> Model View Controller -> Model - -> View - Website -> Controller - program behind it
	Last week -> final project Thursday before graduation -> presentation (individual or group)
	-> standard or custom -> everyone is challenged accordingly
	Quizzes are chill -> unlimited* uses -> makes sure you know the material
	Github
Git
	Add - add files to the repo
	Commit - creates a new save point
	Push - makes changes to LOCAL git files
	Pull - takes someone's code from another computer that they commited
	Branch - your own individual file repo where the changes you make only affects that repo
	Most teams will have a GITHUB MASTER
	Instructor provides github repo
	Code reviews will be done through github repo
Java
	We will be building java projects to meet expectations
	Will practice different layouts/designs -> dreadfully OVER engineered 
	Layers
		Data Layer
		Business Layer
	Eventually build a site - a SITE
Tomorrow
	Java installed
	Netbeans installed -> if other IDE provide a reason why you want to use it
Java Componenets: JVM, JRE, and JDK
	JVM - allows Java to be ran on any device
	JRE - minimum tools needed to run java
	JDK - not necessary to run java but necessary to WRITE java
Languaging Principles
	Comments -> important to have and will save your life
	Identifiers 
	Data Types 
	Statements
	Expressions
	Most modules will have videos
	Very solid videos borderline invaluable
	Watching videos > reading module stuff
Collecting Console Input - Scanner
	Will be using scanner first couple assignments
Flowchart
	Understanding when to go left, go right, go in a loop...
	Will be an assignment where we build a flowchart using draw.io 
	parallelogram is to sure interaction with a user
		showing user something
		user has to input something
	diamond shape is for decision making time
	rectangles is to show process of code
Truth table
	Showing true false values for each expression during boolean operations
	EXCLUSIVE OR = (a^b) - a and b are binarily different 
Switch statement
	case is the starting point
	if no break you can hit more than one case
	will run into case is HIT
